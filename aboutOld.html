This was before convenience store gas stations were built; when the dealer pumped the customer's gas and cleaned their windshield, checked their oil, etc. He owned Shell and Mobil gas stations in Southern Illinois for 17 years. Throughout his life he ran various businesses and or the past 21 years, Mike owned and operated Jetscape Signarama in Fort Myers, Florida, which has since evolved into ReBrandit,LLC.
